See INSTALL for installation instructions. 

This library has a number of software dependencies listed in
INSTALL also.

Not a lot yet, at the moment only basic sockets are supported.

Only server-side sockets at the moment, DNS is the next item

then client-side sockets.

Then more complicated things like message parsing inbound/outbound,

flood/idle protects, more advanced features, etc
